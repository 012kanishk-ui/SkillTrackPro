# SkillTrackPro 📊  
*A Java-based Academic & Skill Tracking System*

## Overview
SkillTrackPro is a console-based Java application designed to help students **plan subjects, log study sessions, analyze progress, and reflect on productivity**.  
The project emphasizes **core computer science fundamentals** such as object-oriented programming, file handling, modular design, and analytics logic.

This project was built as part of hands-on learning and collaborative development within a school Computer Science Club.
